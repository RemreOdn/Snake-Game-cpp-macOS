# Classic Snake Game
I did it as homework for the c++ course.
I have explained most of the code in comment lines.

The snake always starts the game from the center of the game board.

Touching the borders of the game board or the snake eating itself will set the gameOver flag true.

Due to the rectangular shape of the console's cells, there was a speed effect as if the snake was moving faster in the vertical directions than in the horizontal direction. There is a part in the game that reduces this effect.

Although the snake starts its movement slowly, it will gradually accelerate as it eats the fruits.
